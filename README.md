# Dead Island 1.3: What's New in the Latest Patch?
     
Dead Island is a survival horror game that was released in 2011 by Techland. The game is set on a tropical island that has been overrun by zombies. The player can choose from four different characters, each with their own skills and abilities, and team up with other players in co-op mode to fight off the undead hordes.
     
The game received mixed reviews from critics and players, who praised its open-world exploration, melee combat, and co-op features, but criticized its technical issues, voice acting, and story. The game was also controversial for its depiction of violence and gore, as well as its initial release of a debug version that contained unfinished content and features.

To address some of the problems and complaints, Techland released several patches for the game, the most notable one being patch 1.3, which was released on November 11, 2011 for PC and later for consoles. This patch introduced several important bug fixes and improvements for the game, as well as some new features and content. Here are some of the highlights of patch 1.3:
     
- **Level cap raised to 60.** The original level cap was 50, which meant that players could not progress further after reaching it. Patch 1.3 increased the level cap to 60, allowing players to continue leveling up their characters and unlocking new skills and abilities.
- **New blueprints for weapon mods added.** Weapon mods are one of the core features of Dead Island, as they allow players to customize and upgrade their weapons with various materials and components. Patch 1.3 added new blueprints for weapon mods, giving players more options and variety in crafting their weapons.
- **Infected's damage reduced.** Infected are one of the types of zombies in Dead Island, characterized by their speed and agility. They can run faster than the player and can knock them down with their attacks. Patch 1.3 reduced the damage inflicted by infected, making them less deadly and frustrating to deal with.
- **Infected no longer interrupt player's attacks.** Another annoying feature of infected was that they could interrupt the player's attacks with their own, preventing them from finishing their combos or executing critical hits. Patch 1.3 fixed this issue, allowing players to attack infected without being interrupted.
- **A series of improvements to subsequent playthroughs implemented.** Dead Island has a New Game Plus mode, which allows players to start a new game with their existing character and inventory after finishing the main story. Patch 1.3 made several changes to this mode, such as adjusting the XP rewards for quests and challenges, awarding XP for all quests completed in co-op, and adding a new option to adjust the enemies' levels independently for each co-op player.
- **Purna's ammo carrying capacity increased by 50%.** Purna is one of the playable characters in Dead Island, who specializes in firearms. However, ammo is scarce in the game, which limits her effectiveness. Patch 1.3 increased her ammo carrying capacity by 50%, allowing her to use her guns more often and efficiently.
- **Character state from a saved game can now be loaded when using the "Start from Chapter" option.** The "Start from Chapter" option is a feature that allows players to start a new game from any chapter they have previously completed. However, this option did not load the character state from the saved game, which meant that players would lose their inventory, skills, and progress. Patch 1.3 fixed this issue, loading the character state from the saved game when using this option.
- **Improved rewards in weapon crates.** Weapon crates are containers that can be found throughout the island, which contain random weapons or weapon mods. However, these crates often contained low-quality or useless items, making them disappointing to open. Patch 1.3 improved the rewards in weapon crates, making them more valuable and rewarding.
- **All weapon crates now contain rewards.** Another problem with weapon crates was that some of them were empty, which was frustrating for players who spent time and resources to open them. Patch 1.3 ensured that all weapon crates now contain rewards, eliminating the possibility of finding empty crates.

In addition to these changes, patch 1.3 also fixed several bugs and glitches, improved the stability and network performance in co-op mode, added a v-sync option, and implemented some quest and reward fixes. Patch 1.3 was the last official patch for Dead Island, and it improved the game significantly, making it more enjoyable and playable for fans of the genre.
