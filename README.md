# STF

STF (or Smartphone Test Farm) is a web application for debugging smartphones, smartwatches and other gadgets remotely, from the comfort of your browser.

It is currently being used at [CyberAgent](https://www.cyberagent.co.jp/en/) to control a growing collection of more than 160 devices.

## Features

* OS support
  - Android
    * Supports versions 2.3.3 (SDK level 10) to 5.1 (SDK level 22), plus Android M Developer Preview
    * Supports Wear 5.1 (but not 5.0 due to missing permissions)
    * Supports Fire OS, CyanogenMod, and other heavily Android based distributions
* Remote control any device from your browser
  - Real-time screen view
    * Refresh speed can reach 30-40 FPS depending on specs and Android version. See [minicap](https://github.com/openstf/minicap) for more information.
    * Rotation support
  - Supports typing text from your own keyboard
    * Supports meta keys
    * Copy and paste support (although it can be a bit finicky on older devices, you may need to long-press and select paste manually)
    * May sometimes not work well with non-Latin languages unfortunately.
  - Multitouch support on touch screens via [minitouch](https://github.com/openstf/minitouch), two finger pinch/rotate/zoom gesture support on regular screens by pressing `Alt` while dragging
  - Drag & drop installation and launching of `.apk` files
    * Launches main launcher activity if specified in the manifest
  - Reverse port forwarding via [minirev](https://github.com/openstf/minirev)
    * Access your local server directly from the device, even if it's not on the same network
  - Open websites easily in any browser
    * Installed browsers are detected in real time and shown as selectable options
    * Default browser is detected automatically if selected by the user
  - Execute shell commands and see real-time output
  - Display and filter device logs
  - Use `adb connect` to connect to a remote device as if it was plugged in to your computer, regardless of [ADB](http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html) mode and whether you're connected to the same network
    * Run any `adb` command locally, including shell access
    * [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html) and other IDE support, debug your app while watching the device screen on your browser
    * Supports [Chrome remote debug tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging)
* Manage your device inventory
  - See which devices are connected, offline/unavailable (indicating a weak USB connection), unauthorized or unplugged
  - See who's using a device
  - Search devices by phone number, IMEI, ICCID, Android version, operator, product name and/or many other attributes with easy but powerful queries
  - Show a bright red screen with identifying information on a device you need to locate physically
  - Track battery level and health
  - Rudimentary Play Store account management
    * List, remove and add new accounts (adding may not work on all devices)
  - Display hardware specs

## Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 0.12
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) (`npm install -g bower`)
* [RethinkDB](http://rethinkdb.com/) >= 2.0.0
* [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/) (for resizing screenshots)
* [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/) libraries installed
* [Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/google/protobuf) libraries installed

Note that you need these dependencies even if you've installed STF directly from [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), because they can't be included.

On OS X, you can use [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install most of the dependencies:

```bash
brew install rethinkdb graphicsmagick zeromq protobuf
```

You should now be ready to [build](#building) or [run](#running) STF.

## Installation

As mentioned earlier, you must have all of the [requirements](#requirements) installed first. Then you can simply install via NPM:

```bash
npm install -g stf
```

For development, though, you should [build](#building) instead.

## Building

After you've got all the [requirements](#requirements) installed, it's time to fetch the rest of the dependencies.

First, fetch all NPM modules:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, fetch all Bower modules:

```bash
bower install
```

You may also wish to link the module so that you'll be able to access the `stf` command directly from the command line:

```bash
npm link
```

You should now have a working installation for local development.

## Running

STF comprises of several independent processes that must normally be launched separately. In our own setup each one these processes is its own [systemd](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) unit.

For development purposes, however, there's a helper command to quickly launch all required processes along with a mock login implementation. Note however that you **must** have RethinkDB running first.

If you don't have RethinkDB set up yet, to start it up, go to the folder where you'd like RethinkDB to create a `rethinkdb_data` folder (perhaps the folder where this repo is) and run the following command:

```bash
rethinkdb
```

You should now have RethinkDB running locally. Running the command again in the same folder will reuse the data from the previous session.

You're now ready to start up STF itself:

```bash
stf local
```

After the [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) build process has finished (which can take a small while) you should have your private STF running on [http://localhost:7100](http://localhost:7100). If you had devices connected before running the command, those devices should now be available for use. If not, you should see what went wrong from your console. Feel free to plug in or unplug any devices at any time.

Note that if you see your device ready to use but without a name or a proper image, we're probably missing the data for that model in [our device database](https://github.com/openstf/stf-device-db). Everything should work fine either way.
